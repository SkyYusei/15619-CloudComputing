# Qustion 1
# How many rows match 'Aerosmith' (Case sensitive) through the grep command?

# single number to standard output 
answer_1() {

	# use grep the choose Aerosmith and use wc -l to count the number
	grep -P 'Aerosmith' million_songs_metadata.csv| wc -l

# Qustion 2

# artist_name containing "Bob Marley" (Case sensitive)
# Run your commands to process the dataset and output a single number 
# to standard output

# on column 7? The output should be a single number
# Your script should be a single awk command
